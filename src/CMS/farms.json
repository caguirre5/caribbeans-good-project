By nature, these two sons were wise, and their wisdom was great. All the arts were taught to Hunbatz and Hunchouén, the sons of Hun-Hunahpú. They were flautists, singers, shooters with blowguns, painters, sculptors, jewellers and silversmiths. ",
          "The story goes that they climbed a tree; it grew up so tall that Hunbatz and Hunchouen could not get down. As they struggled in the branches, their loincloths came loose and turned into tails; they both became monkeys, one a spider monkey, the other a howler monkey. "
