                <p>Coffee was first introduced to Guatemala in the mid-1700s, but it was not until 1860 that production seriously took off. Prior to that, the plant was only used for ornamental purposes. As the carmine dye industry began to decline, which was the biggest industry in Guatemala at that point, the government searched for new industries to improve the economy.</p>

                    <p>Coffee is harvested once or twice a year, depending on whether it is sun-grown or shade-grown. Guatemala grows coffee under natural shade, using either native species or specific trees. As a result, Guatemala only harvests coffee once a year, making every crop precious to the farmers and their families.</p>

                    <p>When it comes to processing coffee, farmers have a few different options to choose from. Each of these processes can yield unique flavors, so it's important for farmers to carefully consider which one they want to use. One popular option is the washed process, which involves pulping the coffee cherries, washing them, and then drying them. Another option is the honey process, which involves pulping the cherries but skipping the washing step. Finally, there's the natural process, in which the cherries are simply dried without any processing. While each of these methods has its own pros and cons, ultimately it's up to the farmer to decide which one will produce the best coffee for their needs.</p>

                    <p>During the Dry Mill process, coffee beans undergo several steps:</p>

                        <li>A magnet is used to remove any metal or foreign objects.</li>
                        <li>A destoner is used to get rid of rocks.</li>
                        <li>The beans are then polished to remove an outer layer called parchment.</li>
                        <li>The coffee beans are graded based on size, weight, and color.</li>
                        <li>The last step in the dry mill is a hand-picking process to check for defects andÂ imperfections.</li>
